\section{Priority}
\label{sec:anim-pri}
\input{animation/priority.tex}
%% includes animation cancels and such and death animation

\section{Rolling Animation}
\label{sec:rolling-anim}
%% rolling animation gets its own section because of its special properties that unlock lots of speedstrats, including some of its thingswith frame jumps, speedstorage, how to activate before run, punching and with small rayman. Put references to the other parts of the book that talks about these as well. Might move animations to a later point
\input{animation/rolling-animation.tex}

% add other special animations of needed. Maybe add one for enemy animations, though I can't think of any important ones.
